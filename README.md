# Bike Rental Demand Prediction

This project aims to forecast the number of hourly bike rentals based on various features such as weather conditions, time of day and seasonality. The goal is to build a regression model that can accurately predict demand and help optimize bike availability.


## Problem Statement

Predict the number of bikes rented in a given hour using historical data with environmental and time-based features.


## Dataset

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository – Bike Sharing Dataset  
- **File Used**: `hour.csv`  
- **Target Variable**: `cnt` – total count of bike rentals (casual + registered)


## Key Tasks

- Data cleaning and formatting
- Time feature extraction (hour, weekday, month)
- Handling categorical features using encoding
- Visual analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Regression modeling using Linear Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
- Evaluation using RMSE and R² score


## Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
